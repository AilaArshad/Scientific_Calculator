**Scientific Calculator**

This project aims to develop a comprehensive scientific calculator application using Java's Swing library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and the Math library for performing complex mathematical calculations. The calculator will provide a user-friendly interface for performing basic arithmetic operations, as well as advanced functions such as trigonometric, logarithmic, exponential, and statistical calculations.

_**Functionality**_

Basic Arithmetic: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.

Trigonometric Functions: Sine, cosine, tangent, inverse trigonometric functions.

Logarithmic Functions: base-10 logarithm (log).

Power and Root Functions: Exponentiation, square root.

User Interface: Clear and organized layout, easy-to-use buttons, informative display.

Error Handling: Graceful handling of invalid inputs and calculations.

_**Technical Approach**_

Use Java Swing components (JFrame, JPanel, JButton, JTextField, etc.) to create the calculator's GUI.

Employ event listeners to handle button clicks and user input.

Utilize the Java Math library for mathematical operations (sin, cos, tan, log, pow, sqrt, etc.).

Implement a robust calculation logic to process user input and perform calculations accurately.

Consider using regular expressions or input validation to prevent invalid input.

Provide clear and informative error messages for unexpected conditions.

_**Expected Outcome**_

A functional scientific calculator application with a user-friendly interface capable of performing a wide range of mathematical calculations. This calculator only work for two input values.
